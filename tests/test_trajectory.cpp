// pins the shapes; this pins what the controller does with them, which is the
// part a visitor actually watches.
//
// Every combination the UI can be put into is swept, because "the ball stays
// on the plate at every offered speed" is a claim about the SLIDERS, and a
// slider setting that loses the ball is not a choice on offer, it is a trap.
// See issue #24.
