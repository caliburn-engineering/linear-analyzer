// The 3-RRS constraint equations have TWO roots, and the residual norm cannot
// tell them apart.  Beside the assembly the machine is built in — table above
// its knees — there is a folded one with the table lying flat on the base, and
// for this mechanism's parameters that folded root is EXACT: `R_ground ==
// R_table` and `L1 == L2` make `z_c = 0` satisfy every leg's length
// constraint to machine precision, at every servo angle.
//
// Newton does not care which it lands on.  Seeded from a pose that a hard
// manoeuvre has carried down past the knee plane, it converges on the folded
// root in one iteration, reports success with a residual of 1e-11, and stays
// there for the rest of the session — the next frame is seeded from a pose
// that is already a root.  The plate then has no tilt authority at all, and
// every ball put on it rolls off.
//
// That is issue #22, and these are the tests that keep it fixed.
