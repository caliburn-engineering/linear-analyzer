//
// The demo running itself for a visitor who has not arrived yet, and every one
// of its acceptance criteria is phrased as something a person would see:
// "motion is apparent", "the controller is already active at load", "the ball
// never leaves the plate".  None of that can be checked by looking at a canvas
// once and calling it done — the tuning, the plate geometry and the rolling
// model all move underneath it.
//
// So the opening is a pure function of the path and of elapsed time, and this
// file runs it against the same nonlinear plate the browser does.  "Visible"
// becomes millimetres and "the visitor never sees a broken demo" becomes: the
// ball does not leave the plate in ten minutes of unattended running.
//
// **The demo used to kick the ball and does not any more.**  See
// `attract_mode.h` for why — briefly, a kick reads as a fault rather than as a
// disturbance when there is nothing still to read it against, and the opening
// displacement in particular slammed the legs 20.7 degrees apart in three
// frames.  Two consequences for this file:
//
//   - The opening tests are now about a ball tracing a circle from the first
//     frame, and one of them pins the leg swing that used to be the glitch.
//   - The disturbance sweeps stayed.  What they test is a property of the
//     plant and the gain — that a 0.26 m/s shove is rejected from every
//     direction without losing the ball — which is still true, still bounds
//     what #19 may offer, and is no less worth pinning because the demo no
//     longer performs it.  The kick moved from production into `Disturbance`
//     below, where it is honestly a test fixture.
